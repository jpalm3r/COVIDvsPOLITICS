    "Despite the feeling that COVID-19 paralyzed the world, the pandemic itself has been far from still. The spread of the virus has taken many forms, which raised many questions: what is going on in Wuhan? What is going in Italy? How long will the lockdown last? Are masks effective? Which company is making the vaccine?\n",
    "\n",
    "The urgency of such topics has modified our discussions and the way we discuss them. This raised a very simple question: do different people discuss COVID related topics differently? Specifically, do political beliefs affect COVID discussion?\n",
    "Maybe our intuition (and prejudices?) have an answer to that question. Still, this work intends to quantify and visualize if such political bias exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to check it, we have used data from __[Reddit](www.reddit.com)__, given its openness and community-based structure. First, the r/Coronavirus community was analyzed to identify the most relevant COVID-related topics. Afterwards, these topics has been analyzed in mainstream political communities to evaluate if there are differences in their usage.\n"
