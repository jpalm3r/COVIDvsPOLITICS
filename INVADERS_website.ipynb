    "# Introduction \n",
    " \n",
    "By the end of 2019 the SARS-CoV-2 virus strain emerged and developed into a global pandemic. Consequently, (virtually) all aspects of our lives were affected. However, despite the feeling that the virus paralyzed the world, the pandemic itself has been far from still. The spread of the virus has taken many forms, which raised many questions: what is going on in Wuhan? How long will the lockdown last? Are masks effective? Who is manufacturing the vaccines?\n",
    "\n",
    "The urgency of such topics has modified our discussions and the way we discuss them. This raised a very simple question: do different people discuss COVID related topics differently? Specifically, do political beliefs affect COVID discussion?\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe our intuition (and prejudices) have an answer to that question. Still, this work intends to quantify and visualize if such political bias exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "For that, we have used data from __[Reddit](www.reddit.com)__, and analyzed post submissions and comments of key communities. Specifically, we identified key words that represent the topics and questions that the pandemic has raised. Afterwards, these topics have been analyzed in mainstream political communities to evaluate if there are differences in their usage.\n"

    "The year 2020 will be forever linked to the pandemic. The virus started to globally spread during January, and by December the first people started to get vaccinated. Thus, 2020 encapsulates most of the major breakthroughs and controversies that defined COVID-19. For this reason, this work has focused only on using data from this strange year. \n",
    "\n",
    "To represent the major covid-related milestones during 2020, 19 words have been selected from the corpus of all submission titles in the [r/Coronavirus](www.reddit.com/r/coronavirus) community. The following group of infamous words$^{(1)}$ are the most used during 2020:\n",

However, the reactions that they caused might have been different depending on the communities where they were discussed on. To sort this out, the following section compares the usage of the 19 words in the <u>comment</u> sections of major political subreddits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that __Reddit__ is a US-based website, this study has focused to US political communities. So, in order to check differences in political discussion we have focused on two communities dedicated to the two major US political parties: <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/republican\"><span style=\"background:#EC080E;color:white;font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt\"> r/republican </span></a> and <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/republican\"><span style=\"background:#1C81D5;color:white;font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt\"> r/democrats </span></a>.\n",

    "It is clear that controversy generates arguments. \n",

    "As we have seen above studying the [r/Coronaviurs](www.reddit.com/r/coronavirus) community, the volume of these 19 words changed with time, as the relevance of the topics they described shifted.

To clear the search, we focused on days when the use of covid-words was abnormally high, such that we mark with a &#11035; the days when each covid-word surged; the larger the &#11035;, the higher the surge.\n",

    "The previous analysis suggests that there is a difference in how the words are treated in each political community. As we have seen, the use of each word depends: 1) on the specific word and 2) on the time it was used. Then, for an arbitrary month of 2020, we can compare the frequency of the different words in the two political communities such that we get something like this:\n",

If the dots are \"tilted\" towards one community's axis, then that word was systematically more used in that community.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the slope synthetizes the likeness of the use of a word during 2020 in both political communities. But these communities already existed before COVID hit. So, was the usage of these words \"normal\" or was indeed triggered by the pandemic. We measured this by measuring the ratio of the frequency of each word in 2019 and their frequency in 2020.\n",
