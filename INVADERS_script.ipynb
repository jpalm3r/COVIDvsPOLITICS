    "# Introduction \n",
    " \n",
    "By the end of 2019 the SARS-CoV-2 virus strain emerged and developed into a global pandemic. Consequently (virtually) all aspects of our lives were affected. However, despite the feeling that the virus paralyzed the world, the pandemic itself was far from being still. The spread of the virus has taken many forms and raised many questions concerning our safety and well-being: the virus mortality rate, the imposition of nation-wide lockdowns or the effectivity of masks and vaccines... just to name a few. The urgency of such topics pushed them into the front page of all our discussions, as we showed in the <a href=\"https://jpalm3r.github.io/INVADER/\">first issue</a>  of this project. This ever-presence raised a very simple question: <u>do political beliefs affect COVID discussion?</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our intuition (and prejudices) might want to answer these questions right away. For this reason, this work intends to quantify and visualize if such political bias exists. To do it, we have used data from <a href=\"www.reddit.com\">Reddit</a>, and analyzed post submissions and comments of key communities. Specifically, we identified key words that represent the topics and questions that the pandemic has raised. Afterwards, these topics have been analyzed in mainstream political communities to evaluate if there are differences in their usage.\n"
